# Inform and Connect
Inform and connect is a simple web site where important information from multiple governmental institutions is gathered. The information is further translated into the language of choice so that even people that do not speak Swedish are well informed.

Inform and Connect was born as a part of [hackTheCrisis](https://www.hackthecrisis.se/) hackathon (3-5 of April 2020)

UX design by [Maija Perfiljeva](https://github.com/mperfiljeva), [here](https://whimsical.com/SbvkKwSRyFnfmW6SM31Zu6) and final desing [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZISP92E0mYkAtkAB7f6tkm/Connect-and-inform?node-id=0%3A1).
